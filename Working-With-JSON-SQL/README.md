## Steps to take to work with SQL files

Create a Database:

 - Use a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL (provided by XAMPP) to create a database. For example, In the file I created a database named world.
   Import or execute SQL files to populate your database with tables and data.

Set Up XAMPP:

 - Start the Apache and MySQL servers in XAMPP to make the MySQL server run locally.
   Open phpMyAdmin to manage your database through a web interface.

Establish a Connection Between Python and MySQL:

 - Install the required Python library for connecting to MySQL. You can use mysql-connector.
